Notes About Autolabel:

Sequence Name: This is the sequence's name following your project's naming convention. For example, SeqXXX_SeqName.

Shot Prefix: The prefix for the shot, such as a letter "C" or the word "Shot".

Sequence Name and Shot Prefix: These will be concatenated to form the complete label.

Shot Number Increment: Define how your shots increment.

Example: Increment by 1 (Shot001, Shot002) or by 10 (Shot010, Shot020).
Destination Channel: The channel where all the text strips with labels will be created.

Reference Channels: The channels where your labeled shots are located, usually Channel 1 or Channel 2. You can select multiple channels by separating them with commas.

Position X and Position Y: Always edit these to adjust the position of your labels. They might appear misaligned at first!

Font Size: Nothing more to say here, right?

Shadow Box Check: Adds a dark box background to your labels.

Text Color: Self-explanatory. ðŸ˜Š
